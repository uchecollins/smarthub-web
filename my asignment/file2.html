        The Federal Government says it will spend about N34 billion as arrears of Minimum Wage Consequential Adjustments in the education sector effective from 2019.The Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige said that this was aimed at resolving the lingering crisis in the sector, NAN reports.

        Ngige made this known while speaking with newsmen on the prolonged strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), and others on Tuesday in Abuja.
        
        Ngige said that the beneficiaries of the Minimum Wage Consequential Adjustments included the members of the striking ASUU and their counterparts in the polytechnics and Colleges of Education.
        
        According to Ngige, the universities will get N23.5 billion, the polytechnics N6 billion and the Colleges of Education N4 billion, bringing the total sum to N33.5 billion.
        
        The minister, while giving an update on the ongoing strike, said committees were set up during the last tripartite meeting of the government and university based unions.
        
        He said they were given a fortnight to turn in their report, adding they were still working and the reports of the committees were being expected at the end of the week.
        
        “Those committees are working. The one on NITDA is testing the three platforms, the government’s Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS).
        
        “Also the University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS) of ASUU and the Universities Peculiar Personnel Payroll System (UPPPS) of the non-teaching staff.
        
        “They started the testing last Thursday. The National Salaries, Wages and Incomes Commission (NSWIC) has issued their amendment circulars.
        
        “The unions also have copies to take care of responsibility and hazard allowances wherever it has not been properly captured.’’
        
        Ngige assured that there might likely be wage adjustments as the government intensified efforts to streamline wages through the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission.
        
        “For example, we have done it for the police . It wasn’t envisaged that we should do it in pockets.
        
        “You can also see university teachers saying that their own should be done immediately, since we have done for the police. So, something is being done. It was part of the 2009 negotiation they had with the government then.
        
        “So, the committee of Prof. Briggs is on it, discussing with the university unions and their employer, the Federal Ministry of Education. They will bring up something for the government to see.
        
        “There are other people. The doctors are complaining about brain-drain, this and that. Their hazard allowance has to be touched and it was touched by close to 300 per cent.</div></article>

National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) protesting ASUU strike

By joining their university counterparts to stay away from work, the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP)’s strike last week can only lead to grinding the wheel of public higher education to a complete halt. It is not the first time of total blackout of tertiary education in protest against poor funding and deterioration, but none has perhaps stoked youths’ provocation more than the current action is instigating. Youths are losing it on the streets with social tension brewing. Their lecturers too are tired of protesting to an intransigent government that does not care a hoot about education quality. The dilemma, therefore, warrants more pragmatic solutions across the board, to salvage what is left of higher education, rather than insipid insistence on who is right. Of course, government is forever guilty of failing to honour its agreement with the teachers.

It is most disheartening that in this 21st Century that is exclusively governed by the knowledge enterprise where young people are globally busy with blockbuster technological innovations, an army of Nigerian youths are on the streets disrupting traffic flow to draw attention to the plight of their lecturers and institutions. Since February this year, university lectures have been on indefinite warning strike to protest against the government’s infidelity in its 2020 agreement to better the lot of the academic community. The narrative is not any different among the polytechnic lecturers that have begun two-week warning strike to register their displeasure with the government’s failure to keep to the funding agreements they reached almost a year ago. Non-academic staff unions also have their grudges with the government and it bothers on poor funding too. Curiously, these have always been the case since 1999, with public universities observing over 1500 days of strike in 22 years – an equivalent of 20 per cent of each academic year!

Indeed, frustrated lecturers and their disenchanted students are eligible to protest the near-collapse of the educational setting and its near-worthless global ratings. Today, well-off families seeking quality education must look beyond public schools. Depending on how deep the pocket is, their wards will go to either private institutions (which rely on public school lecturers occupying adjunct chairs) or overseas institutions where knowledge and duration are guaranteed. Nigerian students that gained admission into private and foreign schools in 2019 are graduating this summer. Their counterparts in Nigerian public schools are stuck in year-two and uncertain of when they will finish.
